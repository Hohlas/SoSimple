# /graphify

Turn any folder of files into a navigable knowledge graph with community detection, an honest audit trail, and two outputs: GraphRAG-ready JSON, and a plain-language GRAPH_REPORT.md.

## Usage

```
/graphify                                             # full pipeline on current directory
/graphify <path>                                      # full pipeline on specific path
/graphify <path> --update                             # incremental - re-extract only new/changed files
/graphify <path> --cluster-only                       # rerun clustering on existing graph
/graphify <path> --no-viz                             # skip visualization, just report + JSON
/graphify query "<question>"                          # BFS traversal - broad context
/graphify query "<question>" --dfs                    # DFS - trace a specific path
/graphify query "<question>" --budget 1500            # cap query output tokens
/graphify path "AuthModule" "Database"                # shortest path between two concepts
/graphify explain "SwinTransformer"                   # plain-language explanation of a node
```

## What graphify is for

Drop any folder of code, docs, papers, markdown into graphify and get a queryable knowledge graph. Persistent across sessions, honest audit trail (EXTRACTED/INFERRED/AMBIGUOUS), community detection surfaces cross-document connections you wouldn't think to ask about.

## What You Must Do When Invoked

**Fast path — existing graph:** If the user's request is a natural-language question about codebase or documentation relationships (e.g. "How does X work?", "What calls Y?", "Trace the data flow through Z") and NOT an explicit rebuild command (`--update`, `--cluster-only`, or a bare path/URL that implies fresh extraction): run `graphify query "<question>" --budget 1500` immediately. Do not run detect. Do not check corpus size. Do not ask the user to narrow. The graph is already built — use it.

If no path was given, use `.` (current directory). Do not ask the user for a path.

## For --update and --cluster-only

Both are non-default subcommands. `--update` re-extracts only new or changed files; `--cluster-only` reruns clustering on the existing graph.

---

## For /graphify query

When the user asks a question about the corpus, answer from the graph rather than rebuilding it:

```bash
graphify query "<question>" --budget 2000
```

`--budget` caps query output tokens. Use a modest first-pass budget (1500-2000); increase it only if you need more relevant nodes.
Before traversal, expand the question against the graph's own vocabulary so a wording mismatch does not collapse the answer to noise. If the `graphify query` CLI is unavailable, fall back to an inline NetworkX traversal of `graphify-out/graph.json`. Answer using only what the graph output contains, and quote `source_location` when citing a specific fact.

## Honesty Rules

- Never invent an edge. If unsure, use AMBIGUOUS.
- Never skip the corpus check warning.
- Always show token cost in the report.
- Never hide cohesion scores behind symbols - show the raw number.
- Never run HTML viz on a graph with more than 5,000 nodes without warning the user.
